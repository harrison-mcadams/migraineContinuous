Controls:
SS_001 -> I think it's supposed to be SS_1073. I have a picture of the notes I was taking that day. Will omit this data because I think I sped up the routine after
Why do I have 11 controls?







PTHA:
There's one PTHA case that didn't actually have symptoms. ID unknown, but likely the first? (SS_1401?)
- unable to find patient log for SS_1401

Where's the data for SS_1427?

SS_1422 with insufficient data

One migraine case seems to break the numbering rules -- SS_1084

One migraine case with bad data -- SS_1128
